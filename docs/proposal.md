# 2. Background
- Heart attacks are a widespread and life-threatening issue globally, caused by blockages in blood vessels due to plaque buildup. In the United States, a heart attack occurs every 40 seconds, resulting in approximately 805,000 cases annually, with over 600,000 resulting in death. Similarly, India faces a significant burden, with 70% of cardiac deaths occurring in the 30-60 age group. Over the past three years, India has consistently recorded over 28,000 deaths annually due to heart attacks.
  
  ### Problem Statement:
  * Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with early detection and preventive interventions playing pivotal roles in mitigating its impact.
  * The project aims to develop and implement machine learning-based predictive models to accurately identify individuals at high risk of heart attacks. By leveraging demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data, the objective is to create robust models capable of early detection and personalized risk assessment, ultimately enabling proactive interventions and improving patient outcomes.
    
  ### Why does it matter?
  * The proposed project holds significant implications for public health by enabling early identification and targeted intervention for individuals at high risk of cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CVD risk prediction, thereby facilitating more personalized and proactive healthcare approaches.
  * Predicting heart diseases using machine learning matters because it saves lives, improves healthcare efficiency, enhances patient care, fosters innovation, and empowers individuals to take control of their health.
  ### Research questions:
  * How do different machine learning algorithms compare in terms of their predictive performance for identifying individuals at risk of developing heart disease?
  * What are the most influential clinical and demographic factors associated with the occurrence of heart disease, as identified by predictive modeling techniques?
  * which algorithm best suits the model?
  * Success Parameter:Whether the model has predicted & recommended accurately.

    
# 3. Data
  * Data Source: The coronary heart disease dataset (Framingham dataset), which is available for download from University of Washingtonâ€™s Bio-Statistics Class, was used in this study. This data collection is derived from current cardiovascular research of people living in Framingham, Massachusetts.This dataset is on-going research.

 * Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?
   - TenYearCHD: This is our target variable which we will be predicting. Yes(1) and No(0)
   - To determine whether the patient will experience coronary heart disease during the following ten years is the classification goal (CHD).

 * Which variables/columns may be selected as features/predictors for your ML models?
   - We have 4240 records and 16 features associated to the data set. We will be dealing with all the features for our Ml model.
