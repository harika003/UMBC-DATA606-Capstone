# 2. Background
- Nowadays, Heart-attack is the most common life- threatening problem all over the world. 
Blockages occur when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up, forming deposits called plaques in blood vessels. 
These plaques can become damaged over time and may lead to heart attacks.
- In united states someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds.
- Every year, about 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack. Of these, 633,842 are deaths recorded.
- In the same vein, India has become the chronic heart disease capital of the world. According to a recent report 70% of cardiac deaths were recorded between 30-60 age group.
The number of deaths due to heart attacks  in India has remained constantly over 28000 in the last 3 years.
  ### Problem Statement:
  * Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with early detection and preventive interventions playing pivotal roles in mitigating its impact.
  * This project aims to develop a comprehensive framework leveraging machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to achieve two primary objectives:
  * Phase 1: Prediction of Heart Disease
  * Phase 2: Identification of Causal Factors and Prevention Strategies
  ### Research questions:
  * How do different machine learning algorithms compare in terms of their predictive performance for identifying individuals at risk of developing heart disease?
  * What are the most influential clinical and demographic factors associated with the occurrence of heart disease, as identified by predictive modeling techniques?
  * which algorithm best suits the model?
